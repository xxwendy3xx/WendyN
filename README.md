EMS 
You need to create an Employee Management System for a company. This EMS should be able to add new Employees, update Employee information, remove Employees, and list Employee information. The user interface (U/I) will be the terminal console, where you can print the program information, and take in inputs from the user’s standard input (the keyboard). You will need to have a basic menu with options to navigate your application for your users to interact with. Since this is a group project, be sure to organize your team and design your project development pipeline BEFORE you start writing code. You will be using Git with this project, so be aware that merge conflicts and other issues may arise and plan accordingly. It’s recommended that you designate one person to accept pull requests and resolve merge conflicts.
